This repository contains endline survey instrument in XLSForm and XForm standard for use in Open Data Kit developed for UNICEF Mozambique.

This form (`improving_nutrition_status_u5.xlsx` and `improving_nutrition_status_u5.xml`) is for use in the endline survey for the evaluation of the *"Imporving nutrition status for under 5 children in Zambezia and Nampula project"*.

## Usage

For those wanting to test out the forms on their own Android mobile devices, the following application needs to be downloaded and installed from the Google Play Store:

* ODK Collect ([link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android&hl=en_GB&gl=US))

Once this application is installed, there are two options for getting any of these forms onto mobile devices.

1. Using ODK Aggregator or other similar ODK servers

The XLSForm can be uploaded to a remote server-based ODK Aggregator or other ODK servers such as ONA, SurveyCTO, KoBoToolbox and the like. The form is validated and then converted into XML format which can then be retrieved from the server into mobile devices as blank forms.

For the purposes of viewing and testing these forms, a test server has been setup. To view and/or test these forms, ODK Collect in the mobile devices will need to be connected to the server. This is described [here](https://help.ona.io/knowledge-base/guide-using-enketo-odk-collect/#configuring-odk-collect-with-your-ona-account). The following ODK Aggregate server setttings should be used:

url: https://odk.ona.io     
username: validtrial     
password: zEF-STN-5ze-qom     

Once ODK Collect has been connected to the test server, it will now be possible to pull any of these forms into ODK Collect in the mobile device using the instructions found [here](https://help.ona.io/knowledge-base/guide-using-enketo-odk-collect/#downloading-forms-to-your-phone).

Once any of these forms have been pulled into the ODK Collect in the mobile device, the forms can be viewed and tested by following the instructions [here](https://help.ona.io/knowledge-base/guide-using-enketo-odk-collect/#fill-blank-forms).

2. Use XML version and transfer to mobile devices via USB cable connection

The XML version of these forms can then be transferred to the mobile devices (into the device's odk folder) via local USB connection. This can be done by following the instructions [here](https://docs.getodk.org/collect-forms/#loading-forms-from-device-storage). The associated media files for the forms (found in the folder called media in this repository) will also need to be transferred to the mobile device. This can be done by following the instructions [here](https://docs.getodk.org/collect-forms/#loading-form-media).
